# Free Ship Decorations - Lethal Company Mod

Tiring of having to choose between flashlights and the pajamas suit? `Free Ship Decorations` lets you mod your `Lethal Company` game to buy ship decorations in the current rotation for free.

Thanks to this mod, Keep your money for what matters (keeping the company happy!).

## Why?

- Ship decorations do not bring any benefit to the game and are too expensive (900$ for the pajama suit!?).
- This mod does not affect the game difficulty.
- It doesn't make sense to use hard earned money to buy ship decorations rather than gear for missions.

## Install

- Ensure you already have the [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) mod installed
- Download [`LCModFreeShipDecorations.dll`](https://github.com/7PH/free-ship-decorations-lethal-company-mod/releases) and move it to `$YOUR_GAME_FOLDER\BepInEx\plugins\LCModFreeShipDecorations.dll`

## Who needs to install this mod?

Ideally, everyone should have this mod. If someone in the lobby does not have it, he won't be able to buy items for free, but others with the mod will be able to.

## Compatibility

Last tested on `v49`. This mod is small and should work on later versions. Please open an issue if you have compatibility issues.
